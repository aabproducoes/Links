Throughout my journey, I have immersed myself in challenges that have allowed me to grow in many areas. My fascination with technology from an early age has driven me to explore image editing and creation, as well as website development in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, because I love the feeling of bringing ideas to life with attractive design, efficient functionality and interaction effects that turn the ordinary into something extraordinary.

My insatiable curiosity has also led me to uncover the secrets of operating systems, especially Windows and Linux, mastering not only the installation and configuration part, but also understanding how the programs that start with the system work, how to uninstall them correctly, and discovering keyboard shortcuts that make everyday life much easier.

Because I love solving problems, I delved into programming logic, understanding the structure of variables and how to think outside the box to decipher complex situations. Naturally, I made great discoveries about hardware, learning how to assemble PCs with compatible parts and balanced configurations to ensure maximum performance. I also enjoy exploring the Command Prompt (CMD) to explore useful commands, and my fast typing skills allow me to be agile at work and in my studies.

To complement my passion for technology, I started learning how to use Arduino, exploring sensors, actuators and prototyping projects that can combine creativity and real functionality. This practical experience allows me to understand even more the magic that technology offers when it combines knowledge, curiosity and the desire to innovate.

My greatest achievements include website creation projects for my own enjoyment, which results in greater visibility and skill development; all of this is driven by the satisfaction of solving seemingly unsolvable problems and the excitement of seeing ideas come to fruition on the screen. This journey fuels my incessant passion for learning more and more.

The dream that makes my heart beat with excitement? Creating technological solutions that simplify people's lives, making the world more accessible and connected. I believe that by combining creativity, technical knowledge and passion, I can help build a future in which technology is increasingly intuitive, relevant and transformative.
